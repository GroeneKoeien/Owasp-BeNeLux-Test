  title   : Security Engineering for Machine Learning
  abstract: Machine Learning appears to have made impressive progress on many tasks including
            image classification, machine translation, autonomous vehicle control, playing
            complex games including chess, Go, and Atari video games, and more. <br>
            This has led to much breathless popular press coverage of Artificial
            Intelligence, and has elevated deep learning to an almost magical status
            in the eyes of the public.<br>
            ML, especially of the deep learning sort, is not magic, however.  <br>
            ML has become so popular that its application, though often poorly
            understood and partially motivated by hype, is exploding. In my view,
            this is not necessarily a good thing. I am concerned with the systematic
            risk invoked by adopting ML in a haphazard fashion. Our research at the
            Berryville Institute of Machine Learning (BIIML) is focused on understanding
            and categorizing security engineering risks introduced by ML at the design level.<br>
            Though the idea of addressing security risk in ML is not a new one, most
            previous work has focused on either particular attacks against running
            ML systems (a kind of dynamic analysis) or on operational security
            issues surrounding ML.<br>
            This talk focuses on two threads&#58; building a taxonomy of known attacks
            on ML and the results of an architectural risk analysis (sometimes
            called a threat model) of ML systems in general.<br>
            A list of the top five (of 78 known) ML security risks will be presented.

  title   : Gamification of Agile Threat Modelling Using OWASP Cornucopia
  abstract: Traditional threat modelling could be described as problematic and time consuming,
            so does the practice serve a purpose in the world where DevOps is a thing,
            and if so, how? Can you get the right balance of rigour and agility from traditional
            threat modelling tools and what options does gamification bring to the table? <br>
            We will look at an OWASP project I've found to be very useful in getting value
            out of threat modelling in the agile world of rapid delivery&#58; Cornucopia.

            Anastasiia is a software engineer with a wide background, she started
            her career as a mobile developer, then deepen into security engineering.
            Now she is focused on cryptography/applied security, she helps companies
            to build secure yet usable systems (oh yes, it takes efforts). <br>
            Anastasiia maintains open-source cryptographic library Themis,
            conducts secure software development training, often speaks at
            international conferences, co-organizes cyber-security events and
            leads security chapter at WomenWhoCode Kyiv.
  title   : Maintaining Crypto Library for 12 Languages
  abstract: Maintaining cross-platform cryptographic library is a journey full of
            unexpected bugs, language-specific hacks, difficult decisions and
            endless struggle to make developer-facing APIs easy-to-use and
            hard-to-misuse.<br>
            We will talk about API design, multi-platform specifics (oh Apple),
            testing and supporting documentation. The talk will be useful for
            anyone who has their own open source project; or uses one &#58;)

  title   : Continuous Threat Modeling for Development Teams
  abstract: The recent increase in popularity of Threat Modeling has repeatedly pointed
            at the necessity for threat modeling methodologies that work in an agile environment
            where design changes with implementation and emerging constraints. CTM (Continuous
            Threat Modeling) is a methodology proposing to help development teams close this gap.

  title   : Panel talk&#58; Agile Threat Modeling
  abstract: During this session we have 2 renowned threat modeling authors&#58;
            Izar Tarandach and Brook Schoenfield, discussing how to combine threat
            modeling with agile development.<br>
            Threat modeling is a risk-based approach to designing secure systems.
            It is based on identifying threats in order to develop mitigations to them.<br>
            In software development, agile practices approach discovering
            requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative
            effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their
            end users. How can threat modeling as a practice be embedded in
            agile development will be the main theme of this session.<br>
            Brook and Izar will first set the stage by presenting respectively&#58;<br>
            - Where does threat modelling fit within software security (an SDL)?<br>
            - Threat modeling for Agile teams?<br>
            Followed by a panel discussion moderated by Sebastien Deleersnyder, Toreon.
