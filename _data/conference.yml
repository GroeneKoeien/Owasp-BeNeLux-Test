  title   : Security Engineering for Machine Learning
  abstract: Machine Learning appears to have made impressive progress on many tasks including
            image classification, machine translation, autonomous vehicle control, playing
            complex games including chess, Go, and Atari video games, and more. <br>
            This has led to much breathless popular press coverage of Artificial
            Intelligence, and has elevated deep learning to an almost magical status
            in the eyes of the public.<br>
            ML, especially of the deep learning sort, is not magic, however.  <br>
            ML has become so popular that its application, though often poorly
            understood and partially motivated by hype, is exploding. In my view,
            this is not necessarily a good thing. I am concerned with the systematic
            risk invoked by adopting ML in a haphazard fashion. Our research at the
            Berryville Institute of Machine Learning (BIIML) is focused on understanding
            and categorizing security engineering risks introduced by ML at the design level.<br>
            Though the idea of addressing security risk in ML is not a new one, most
            previous work has focused on either particular attacks against running
            ML systems (a kind of dynamic analysis) or on operational security
            issues surrounding ML.<br>
            This talk focuses on two threads&#58; building a taxonomy of known attacks
            on ML and the results of an architectural risk analysis (sometimes
            called a threat model) of ML systems in general.<br>
            A list of the top five (of 78 known) ML security risks will be presented.

            (O’Reilly, 2020) together with Threat Modeling.
  title   : Continuous Threat Modeling for Development Teams
  abstract: The recent increase in popularity of Threat Modeling has repeatedly pointed
            at the necessity for threat modeling methodologies that work in an agile environment
            where design changes with implementation and emerging constraints. CTM (Continuous
            Threat Modeling) is a methodology proposing to help development teams close this gap.

  title   : A threat modelling experience
  abstract: Unfortunately, there are many misconceptions about threat modelling.
            Particularly, threat modelling is too often performed exactly once after
            what is to be implemented has been decided, that is, after the
            “architecture” or “design” is finished. We’ve learned that threat
            modelling must integrate organically with development practices,
            whatever those may be, if the analysis is to be effective. But, is
            “agile threat modelling” even possible, given this widely held view
            that a threat model is a point-in-time activity, perhaps executed by
            security specialists who are not a part of an Agile team?<br>
            This talk will answer these questions definitively, based on decades of
            experience with thousands of developers. In addition, the talk
            will cover what we may expect to gain from a threat model, how the
            threat model adds unique value to software development that is
            difficult to achieve through other means. We will also survey the
            role of automation for threat modelling at today’s state of the art.

  title   : Panel talk&#58; Agile Threat Modeling
  abstract: During this session we have 2 renowned threat modeling authors&#58;
            Izar Tarandach and Brook Schoenfield, discussing how to combine threat
            modeling with agile development.<br>
            Threat modeling is a risk-based approach to designing secure systems.
            It is based on identifying threats in order to develop mitigations to them.<br>
            In software development, agile practices approach discovering
            requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative
            effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their
            end users. How can threat modeling as a practice be embedded in
            agile development will be the main theme of this session.<br>
            Brook and Izar will first set the stage by presenting respectively&#58;<br>
            - Where does threat modelling fit within software security (an SDL)?<br>
            - Threat modeling for Agile teams?<br>
            Followed by a panel discussion moderated by <strong>Sebastien Deleersnyder</strong>, Toreon.

  title   : Gamification of Agile Threat Modelling Using OWASP Cornucopia
  abstract: Traditional threat modelling could be described as problematic and time consuming,
            so does the practice serve a purpose in the world where DevOps is a thing,
            and if so, how? Can you get the right balance of rigour and agility from traditional
            threat modelling tools and what options does gamification bring to the table? <br>
            We will look at an OWASP project I've found to be very useful in getting value
            out of threat modelling in the agile world of rapid delivery&#58; Cornucopia.

            serves as a Principal Consultant at ClaritySec, Inc. and as an Adjunct Professor
            at SUNY Polytechnic Institute. Prior to this, he was the US Manager for Penetration
            Testing & Red Teaming at National Grid. In his spare time, Jeff enjoys experimenting

  title   : OWASP Amass&#58; You Can't Protect What You Don't Know You Have
  abstract: The OWASP Amass Project provides a tool to help information security
            professionals perform attack surface mapping and asset discovery using
            open-source information gathering and network reconnaissance.
            Attack surface mapping is an important task for red teams and blue teams,
            yet also filled with many steps, making it tedious and error-prone.
            The OWASP Amass Project allows information security professionals to
            bring automation and organization to their asset discovery process.
            This focus area is growing in importance as CISOs report that complexity
            is their number one challenge due to the need to protect more assets,
            while technology and people are being spread further across the Internet,
            creating a more dynamic and less predictable attack surface.  
            <br>

            - Introduction to the OWASP Amass Project<br>
