<p>This year the OWASP BeNeLux Days will be organized in an online fashion.<br>
As such, we also opted to change the format. <br>
Instead of 1 day of trainings and 1 full day of conference, we compiled a 4-evening program (19h30-21h)
in the week of November 23rd.<Br>
Every evening we have 1 or more speakers on a particular topic, and make sufficient time for a Q&A discussion:
