      <h2>Security Engineering for Machine Learning by Gary McGraw, Ph.D.</h2>
      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>Machine Learning appears to have made impressive progress on many tasks including image classification, machine translation, autonomous vehicle control, playing complex games including chess, Go, and Atari video games, and more. This has led to much breathless popular press coverage of Artificial Intelligence, and has elevated deep learning to an almost magical status in the eyes of the public.<br /> ML, especially of the deep learning sort, is not magic, however.  ML has become so popular that its application, though often poorly understood and partially motivated by hype, is exploding. In my view, this is not necessarily a good thing. I am concerned with the systematic risk invoked by adopting ML in a haphazard fashion. Our research at the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning (BIIML) is focused on understanding and categorizing security engineering risks introduced by ML at the design level.<br /> Though the idea of addressing security risk in ML is not a new one, most previous work has focused on either particular attacks against running ML systems (a kind of dynamic analysis) or on operational security issues surrounding ML.<br /> This talk focuses on two threads&#58; building a taxonomy of known attacks on ML and the results of an architectural risk analysis (sometimes called a threat model) of ML systems in general.<br /> A list of the top five (of 78 known) ML security risks will be presented.</p>

      <h2>Gamification of Agile Threat Modelling Using OWASP Cornucopia by Grant Ongers</h2>
      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>Traditional threat modelling could be described as problematic and time consuming, so does the practice serve a purpose in the world where DevOps is a thing, and if so, how? Can you get the right balance of rigour and agility from traditional threat modelling tools and what options does gamification bring to the table? <br /> We will look at an OWASP project I've found to be very useful in getting value out of threat modelling in the agile world of rapid delivery&#58; Cornucopia.</p>
        <br />
			<h4>Bio:</h4>
				<p>Grant's experience spans Dev - building platforms for regulated industries for more than 10 years. 20+ years in Ops, everything from managing operations in NOCs to mainframe and DBs. He also has over 30 years pushing the limits of (Info)Sec - mostly white-hat.<br /> Grant’s community involvement is global&#58; Staff at BSides (London, Las Vegas, and Cape Town), Goon at DEF CON (USA) for nearly ten years and DC2721 co-founder, staff at BlackHat (USA and EU), and OWASP Global Board member.</p>

      <h2>Continuous Threat Modeling for Development Teams by Izar Tarandach</h2>
      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>The recent increase in popularity of Threat Modeling has repeatedly pointed at the necessity for threat modeling methodologies that work in an agile environment where design changes with implementation and emerging constraints. CTM (Continuous Threat Modeling) is a methodology proposing to help development teams close this gap.</p>
        <br />
			<h4>Bio:</h4>
				<p>Izar Tarandach is a Sr. Security Architect at Bridgewater Associates. Previously he was Lead Product Security Architect. He has co-authored 'Threat Modeling&#58; A Practical Guide for Development Teams' with Matt Coles (O'Reilly, Dec/2020) and is project leader for pytm, a 'threat-modeling-with-code' tool.</p>

      <h2>Maintaining Crypto Library for 12 Languages by Anastasiia Voitova</h2>
      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>Maintaining cross-platform cryptographic library is a journey full of unexpected bugs, language-specific hacks, difficult decisions and endless struggle to make developer-facing APIs easy-to-use and hard-to-misuse.<br /> We will talk about API design, multi-platform specifics (oh Apple), testing and supporting documentation. The talk will be useful for anyone who has their own open source project; or uses one &#58;)</p>
        <br />
			<h4>Bio:</h4>
				<p>Head of Customer Solutions, Security Software Engineer @CossackLabs<br /> Anastasiia is a software engineer with a wide background, she started her career as a mobile developer, then deepen into security engineering. Now she is focused on cryptography/applied security, she helps companies to build secure yet usable systems (oh yes, it takes efforts). <br /> Anastasiia maintains open-source cryptographic library Themis, conducts secure software development training, often speaks at international conferences, co-organizes cyber-security events and leads security chapter at WomenWhoCode Kyiv.</p>

      <h2>Panel talk&#58; Agile Threat Modeling by Izar Tarandach and Brook S.E. Schoenfield</h2>
      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>During this session we have 2 renowned threat modeling authors&#58; Izar Tarandach and Brook Schoenfield, discussing how to combine threat modeling with agile development.<br /> Threat modeling is a risk-based approach to designing secure systems. It is based on identifying threats in order to develop mitigations to them.<br /> In software development, agile practices approach discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their end users. How can threat modeling as a practice be embedded in agile development will be the main theme of this session.<br /> Brook and Izar will first set the stage by presenting respectively&#58;<br /> - Where does threat modelling fit within software security (an SDL)?<br /> - Threat modeling for Agile teams?<br /> Followed by a panel discussion moderated by Sebastien Deleersnyder, Toreon.</p>
        <br />
